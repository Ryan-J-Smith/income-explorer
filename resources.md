Income is closely related to receiving property tax credits in Maryland.  In [a previous hackathon project](http://www.baltimoretaxcredit.com/) I identified which properties in Baltimore City are owner occupied and additionally which ones further claimed the credit already.

I began making maps on and off in 2013.  Since then I have generated [some additional maps of Baltimore](http://www.bmoremapped.com/) from time to time.

* [US Census ACS Data Summary Files](http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-survey-5-year-data.html) - These are useful for identifying the variable codes needed for attributes other than income.

* [Baltimore Neighborhood Indicator Alliance (BNIA)s](http://bniajfi.org/) - A good resource for data in many categories aggregated for Baltimore City

* D3 can be very unintuitive.  For my visualizations, I relied heavily on code examples from [Mike Bostock](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606) and [Christopher Ingraham](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/09/17/cold-weather-person-or-hot-weather-lover-this-map-shows-where-you-belong/)
